Tarkov balance is bad for a single player experience.
Making sensible but not meta decisions for every part can quickly lead to a gun less than half as effective as a meta gun.
I aim to change this.
I have broken foregrips into 4 categories:
high ergo -> -1% recoil / +14 ergo
medium ergo -> -2% recoil / +10 ergo
medium recoil -> -3% recoil / +6 ergo
high recoil -> -4% recoil / +2 ergo

This should allow you to feel comfortable chosing any foregrip you want based on looks and mission.
Need to reduce a lot of recoil? You have black plastic, metal, FDE, and framey options.
Need to reduce a little recoil? See above.

I have a lot of love for our FDE operators, so all meta builds now have an FDE option.
But, black is good too, and the same is true for black.
